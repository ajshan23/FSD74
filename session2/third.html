    <h1>Gandhi</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[c] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)[2] was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial
        nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for
        India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The
        honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in
        1914, is now used throughout the world.[3]

        Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London
        and was called to the bar at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a
        successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a
        lawsuit.<br /> He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed
        nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about
        organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax.</p>
